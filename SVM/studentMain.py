########################## SVM #################################
### we handle the import statement and SVC creation for you here
from sklearn.svm import SVC
clf = SVC(kernel="linear")

#### now your job is to fit the classifier
#### using the training features/labels, and to
#### make a set of predictions on the test data
clf.fit(features_train, labels_train)


#### store your predictions in a list named pred
pred = clf.predict(features_test)

### accuracy
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
